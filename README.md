# Oasis Real Estate Simulation (Dongguan Edition)

This is an agent-based model simulation of the Dongguan real estate market, featuring LLM-driven agents (Buyer/Seller), complex transaction logic, and market reporting.

## 📂 Project Structure

### Core Components
- **`simulation_runner.py`**: The **Main Entry Point**. Run this to start the complete simulation.
- `generate_simulation_report.py`: Automatically generates reports (`agent_personas`, `decisions`, `market_report`, `negotiations`) after a run.
- `models.py`: Data models (`Agent`, `Market`, `Property`, etc.).
- `agent_behavior.py`: Core logic for Agent thinking, profiling, and decision making (LLM integration).
- `transaction_engine.py`: Handles listings, matching, negotiation, and transaction execution.
- `property_initializer.py`: Initializes the market with Dongguan-based property data (Zones A/B/C).
- `mortgage_system.py`: Loan and affordability calculations.

### Directories
- **`results/`**: Stores simulation output (CSVs and Logs) for each run, timestamped.
    - `agents.csv`, `properties.csv`, `trans.csv`, `thoughts.csv`, `console_log.txt`.
- **`reports/`**: Stores the latest analysis reports (Markdown).
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation, manual, and guides.
    - `CONDA_安装指南.md`, `REAL_ESTATE_MANUAL.md`, etc.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files.
- **`scripts/`**: SQL database initialization scripts.
- **`_archive/`**: Old demos, unused scripts, and the visual dashboard (`real_estate_app.py`).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Activate Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda activate oasis
   ```

2. **Run Simulation**:
   ```bash
   python simulation_runner.py
   ```
   *The simulation will initialize the market, run for the configured months (default 12), and automatically generate reports.*

3. **Check Results**:
   - Data: `results/result_<timestamp>/`
   - Reports: `reports/`

## 📊 Features
- **LLM-Driven Agents**: Agents have unique backstories, careers, and financial situations generated by LLM.
- **Dynamic Market**: property prices fluctuate based on supply/demand logic.
- **Complex Negotiation**: Buyers and Sellers negotiate prices in multi-round dialogue.
- **Reporting**: Automatic generation of human-readable reports on market health and agent behavior.
